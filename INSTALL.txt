To install this the dirty manual way, place all files in your TEST apache folder, then export the site.sql file into a test database.
Then setup inc/db_info.php with the correct connect info to your database.

The two included sql files are for if your checking this out on a test machine that does not have a opensim grid installed on it.

This version is to just see my idea, its more like a demo preview concept idea then a full production version and to get a idea of what i like to do.
